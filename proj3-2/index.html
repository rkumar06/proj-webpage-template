        <p>
            With max ray depth of 0, there is no light bouncing or hitting other objects so it renders a dark box that only illuminates the light source. 
		With max ray depth of 1, the light lights up the room, but because of the material of the spheres, it needs another light bounce to see the 
		reflection of the mirrored ball, and more light bounces to see the refraction in the other ball. In max ray depth of 2, we can see the reflection 
		of the mirror ball now; however, there hasn't been enough light bounces to see the refraction in the ball. We only see the slight reflection off 
		the top from the light bounce. When we hit the max ray depth of 3, the refraction ball fits into the scene a lot better and we can see the refraction 
		on the ball. This image is mostly missing some minor details that come with more ray bounces. With max ray depth of 4, we can see that in the reflection 
		ball, the ball is now blue instead of black since the extra bounce allows it to process the data of the light bounce. There is also a light light bounce 
		on the wall that comes from the refraction ball. With max ray depth of 5, the room gets slightly brighter along with the small light reflection on the 
		bottom right of the scene. Between may ray depth of 5 and max ray depth of 100, there is very little difference since the bounces get less noticable 
		as it iterates through it. There are minor details that change like the small reflection on the right of the scene and the general brightness of the scene; 
		however, all these changes are barely noticable which demonstrates how there is a limit of how many light bounces are needed for each scene since the light 
		becomes so minimal that it's not noticeable by the human eye.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 2. Microfacet Material</h3>
        <p><b>
            Show a screenshot sequence of 4 images of scene `CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae` rendered with $\alpha$ set to 0.005, 0.05, 0.25 and 0.5. The other settings should be at least 128 samples per pixel and 1 samples per light. The number of bounces should be at least 5. Describe the differences between different images. Note that, to change the $\alpha$, just open the .dae file and search for `microfacet`.

            Show two images of scene `CBbunny_microfacet_cu.dae` rendered using cosine hemisphere sampling (default) and your importance sampling. The sampling rate should be fixed at 64 samples per pixel and 1 samples per light. The number of bounces should be at least 5. Briefly discuss their difference.
