        <p>
            With max ray depth of 0, there is no light bouncing or hitting other objects so it renders a dark box that only illuminates the light source. 
		With max ray depth of 1, the light lights up the room, but because of the material of the spheres, it needs another light bounce to see the 
		reflection of the mirrored ball, and more light bounces to see the refraction in the other ball. In max ray depth of 2, we can see the reflection 
		of the mirror ball now; however, there hasn't been enough light bounces to see the refraction in the ball. We only see the slight reflection off 
		the top from the light bounce. When we hit the max ray depth of 3, the refraction ball fits into the scene a lot better and we can see the refraction 
		on the ball. This image is mostly missing some minor details that come with more ray bounces. With max ray depth of 4, we can see that in the reflection 
		ball, the ball is now blue instead of black since the extra bounce allows it to process the data of the light bounce. There is also a light light bounce 
		on the wall that comes from the refraction ball. With max ray depth of 5, the room gets slightly brighter along with the small light reflection on the 
		bottom right of the scene. Between may ray depth of 5 and max ray depth of 100, there is very little difference since the bounces get less noticable 
		as it iterates through it. There are minor details that change like the small reflection on the right of the scene and the general brightness of the scene; 
		however, all these changes are barely noticable which demonstrates how there is a limit of how many light bounces are needed for each scene since the light 
		becomes so minimal that it's not noticeable by the human eye.

            We rendered these images with a sample rate of 128, 4 samples per light, and 7 bounces. When we change the alpha value, we notice that more of the color comes through. As we increase
		the alpha value, the dragon looks more and more like it is made out of gold in terms of shininess, texture, and color.

            Show two images of scene `CBbunny_microfacet_cu.dae` rendered using cosine hemisphere sampling (default) and your importance sampling.

        <p>
            The two images are generated with the same sampling rate except one uses cosine hemishpere sampling and one uses importance sampling. The image generated with 
		importance sampling would typically habe less noise because it focuses on imporant samples but we used a high sample rate so the two images
		look similar.
